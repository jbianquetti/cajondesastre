If you want that your vm take  the  current dirname as hostname, include this in Vagrantfile


   config.vm.host_name =  Dir.getwd.split("/")[-1] <-- Unix Only, Windows must be much similar

Example: 

You have a dir /home/user/vagrant_playground/chef-sybase. 
With this hack, the vm hostname sets to "chef-sybase". 

Damn Cool!
