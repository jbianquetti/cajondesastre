  describe "files" do

    # = Testing that a file exists =
    #
    # The simplest assertion is that a file exists following the Chef run:
    it "creates the config file" do
      file("/etc/fstab").must_exist
    end

    # All of the matchers starting with 'must_' also have a negative 'wont_'.
    # So conversely we can also check that a file does not exist:
    it "ensures that the foobar file is removed if present" do
      file("/etc/foobar").wont_exist
    end

    # = Testing for behaviour =
    #
    # Chef has multiple resource types that create files. We use file to test
    # all of them.
    #
    # This is not valid:
    #
    #     cookbook_file(file_path).must_exist
    #
    # Testing the behaviour - is the file is created with the right content?
    # - is preferable to testing how the file gets there. This way if your
    # recipe switches from using a cookbook_file resource to a template resource
    # your tests should still work.

    # Let's go beyond just checking for existence to testing the other file
    # attributes.

    # = Other file attributes =

    # Use .with on a resource and specify the attribute and expected value:
    it "has the expected ownership and permissions" do
      file("/etc/fstab").must_exist.with(:owner, "root")
    end

    # You can also use .must_have:
    it "only root can modify the config file" do
      file("/etc/fstab").must_have(:mode, "644")
    end

    # And you can chain attributes together if you are asserting several.
    # You don't want to get too carried away doing this but it can be useful.
    it "only root can modify the config file" do
      file("/etc/fstab").must_have(:mode, "644").with(:owner, "root").and(:group, "root")
    end

    # Alternatively you could express it like this so each assertion is nicely
    # self-contained:
    describe "only root can modify the config file - alternate syntax" do
      let(:config) { file("/etc/fstab") }
      it { config.must_have(:mode, "644") }
      it { config.must_have(:owner, "root") }
      it { config.must_have(:group, "root") }
    end

    # = Checking file content =

    # You can check if a config file contains a string:
    it "sets phasers to stun" do
      file('/tmp/foo').must_include 'phaser_setting=stun'
    end

    # Or if a file matches a regular expression:
    it "sets phasers to off or stun" do
      file('/tmp/foo').must_match /^phaser_setting=(off|stun)$/
      file('/tmp/foo').wont_match /^phaser_setting=kill$/

    # = Directories =

    # directories:
    it { directory("/etc/").must_exist.with(:owner, "root") }

    # = Links =

    it "symlinks the foo in" do

    #
    # When writing cookbooks intended for use on multiple different operating
    # systems or flavors you will often need to supply a different package
    # name based on the node.platform.
    #
    # If you choose to test for package installation in your tests then you
    # will also need to provide the right package name, which can lead to

      group("chipmunks").must_include(['alvin', 'simon'])
      group("chipmunks").wont_include('michelangelo')

    # Alternatively rather than checking if the group includes specific users
    # you can test that the group is made up of exactly the users you specify:
